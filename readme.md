Solution for Part 1 and 2 with typing. Again I have left out the inputData. I have chained the logging configuration. It
is now controlled by the log.ini file. This shortens the code and it is easier set. To get the debug output one has to
change level = INFO to level = DEBUG. I have also added test cases with the data given by the examples in the
introduction.
